# Welcome {.unnumbered}

We welcome you to the second installment of the General Linear Modeling course. The course website was brought to you by the good folks at Posit or, more specifically, by the software they created. Our syllabus here will be generated by quarto and maintained by me throughout the semester. New, innovative slides will be added to aide in content delivery and, indirectly, to your mastery. So stay tuned for updates. Bookmark this page or download the pdf version.
